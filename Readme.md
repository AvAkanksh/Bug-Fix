# This are some of my Bugs which i Fixed for myself searching Google

## Termial Related Problems:

### Port not getting killed

- use kill -9 {PID Numbre}

### How to check for the currently running ports on pc:

- use netstat -atp (this lists a-  (all) t - (tcp6 and tcp) and p - (PID) )

- use netstat -atp | grep {keyword} 

- use netstat -h  (or) man netstat ; for further help 

### How to check all the configuration of the pc on linux

- use pfetch or neofetch (pfetch is a ligher version of neofetch)

### Suddenly on termial i ran the command import {something} before opening the python shell so now my cursor changed to thick plus and all my mouse click are dead so i used this command

- killall -KILL import
